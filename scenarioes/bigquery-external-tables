Bigquery supports analytics on data through external tables from Cloud Storage and Bigtable. It is perfect for this use case.  
It suggests creating two separate BigQuery external tables on Cloud Storage and Cloud Bigtable.  
By doing so, the data from both sources can be directly queried and joined in BigQuery without the need for additional data movement or processing.  
The join can be performed using the user fields, and appropriate filters can be applied to retrieve the required data efficiently.  
This approach minimizes data movement, reduces processing overhead, and provides an efficient way to join data from both Cloud Spanner and Cloud Bigtable.
