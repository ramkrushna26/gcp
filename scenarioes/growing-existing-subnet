the main issue is the depletion of available IP addresses in the subnet used by the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters.  
By expanding the CIDR range of the subnet, you're essentially increasing the pool of available IP addresses within that subnet.  
This expansion allows for accommodating additional nodes in the existing GKE clusters without requiring the complexity of creating new subnets or VPCs.  
This solution ensures scalability within the current setup.  
As the company grows and requires more resources within the GKE clusters, having an expanded CIDR range provides the flexibility to add more nodes without hitting IP address limitations.
