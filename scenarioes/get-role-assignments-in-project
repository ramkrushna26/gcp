viewing the role assignments in the command line is the fastest and easiest way to check who has what role.  
Running the command "gcloud projects get-iam-policy" provides a comprehensive view of the current role assignments within a GCP project.  
This command retrieves the IAM policy for a project and displays all the role assignments, which include the project owner role.  
This allows the security team to inspect and determine who has the project owner role in the GCP project.
