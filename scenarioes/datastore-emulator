By installing this component using the apt-get install command, you can set up a local testing environment that emulates Cloud Datastore. This way, you can test your HRMS software locally without the need to deploy it to GCP. The emulator simulates Cloud Datastore behavior, allowing you to perform data operations locally during development and testing.  
  
"google-cloud-sdk-datastore-emulator" component allows you to run a local emulator for Cloud Datastore, which can be used to test the application without deploying it to GCP.
