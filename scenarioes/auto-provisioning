Node auto-provisioning is a mechanism of the cluster autoscaler, which scales on a per-node pool basis.  
With node auto-provisioning enabled, the cluster autoscaler can extend node pools automatically based on the specifications of unschedulable Pods.  
Using the GKE cluster's node auto-provisioning feature allows for dynamically provisioning nodes with GPUs only when they are needed. This helps optimize cost as resources are only allocated as necessary.
